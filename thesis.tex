\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}

Software engineering develops faster than ever, the amount of novelties in
platforms, languages, operational strategies and generally the terminology
around it gets larger and larger every day.
One of the terms that gained a lot of traction in recent years is \textit{microservices}.
Many engineers talk about their benefits and challenges but the general notion
is positive and the buzz is undeniable.
At the end of the day, microservices are nothing more than an architectural style
for designing back-end software.
For those that actually take the step to build and deploy such an application
landscape, the journey is not always straightforward.
The idea is still evolving and mandates many new strategies and concepts
that developers and operations have to deal with
when choosing to devote their business logic to leverage microservices.

There are many good reasons to employ this pattern nowadays specifically
when dealing with ever larger growing monolithic applications that try to
encapsulate their respective business logic without drowning the
developers and engineers working on it in seemingly endless complexity
that a single human cannot even fully comprehend anymore at one point.

For many companies, this oftentimes is the status quo and if the decision is
made to move to a microservices-based architecture, one of the first
challenges, the decomposition, is already difficult to begin with:\\
Defining where within the existing application one service should end and the
next one should begin --- i.e. detecting latent boundaries that partition
the monolith into many smaller pieces, is a very manual and tedious task.

Thus, this thesis develops an algorithmic methodology that can assist
a human software engineer in performing the aforementioned decomposition.


\section{Problem analysis}

Generally speaking, there are two ways to put a microservices-based
software architecture into place. The greenfield approach, meaning that
microservices are directly getting built without a preexisting application,
as well as the transformation of an existing monolithic software solution
into independent microservices \cite{fowler-break-monolith}.
However, this thesis focuses solely on the latter approach for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, our work leverages static and dynamic program analysis for solving
the posed task. Obviously, this is not possible without an already running solution.

Secondly, while there is already some research on this topic \cite{fritzsch2018monolith},
which is discussed in the \nameref{chap:related} chapter, the notion
of utilizing the already existing and running application is still underrepresented.

Thirdly, as Martin Fowler remarks, microservices are especially feasible
with a mature workflow, domain model, operational model, etc. already
in place \cite{fowler-monolith-first} \cite{fowler-microservices-tradeoffs}
which favors non-greenfield approaches as well.

The task of getting the boundaries of each microservice right is hard,
especially when the teams working on the existing software
are caught up in their mental models of it \cite{latoza2006maintaining},
as Fritzsch et al. confirm: \textit{"Extracting a domain model from
an application's code base can be a significant challenge. If incorrectly applied,
it can lead to architectures that combine the drawbacks of both styles,
monolithic architectures and Microservices."}\cite{fritzsch2018monolith}
To prevent such an outcome, we propose a visual approach to assist software engineers
and architects in decomposing microservices out of an existing monolithic code base.
This approach has the advantage that the mental models regarding the existing
solution might be broken apart partially to offer new perspectives onto how
the current software works, which was already remarked as a positive side effect
of an assisted microservices decomposition approach \cite{gysel2016service}.
Thus, the engineers and architects can be assisted in the first step,
which is likely also the most difficult and time-consuming one due to the possible
complexity of the system \cite{fritzsch2018monolith} \cite{france2007model},
when undertaking the operation of transforming their existing
monolithic solution into microservices.

Additionally, we are certain that the actual decisions should still be made
by seasoned engineers and architects which is why a visual solution
was determined as the best option to actually support them in their
decision making while not taking the decision making away from them
(i.e. compared to an automated decomposition approach).
As a consequence, everything mentioned in this section reflects itself in
the following research questions of this thesis project.
